                I was raised in Rapid City, South Dakota and am now a 4th year Bachelors student at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I plan on graduating with a degree in computer science and minors in Business Administration and Mathematics. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My primary coding language is C++ and I have been working with this language extensively since the beginning of my college education. I also have moderate experience in the languages C and Python with minor experience in LISP, PHP, HTML, and Java. I love learning new languages and am excited by opportunities to do so.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I am a problem solver at heart and understand the necessity of taking control of my own learning and success. For this reason, I take alot of initiative in preparing for any position I am about to face.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In my free time, I devote myself to my hobbies. I love traveling, backpacking, extreme sports, cycling, drawing, and basic graphic design. I think that that these give me a well rounded skill set and allow me to mold into any environment.
